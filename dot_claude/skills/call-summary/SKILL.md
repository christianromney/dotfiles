## What I Need From You

**Option 1: Paste your notes**
Just paste whatever you have — bullet points, rough notes, stream of consciousness. I'll structure it.

**Option 2: Paste a transcript**
If you have a full transcript from your video conferencing tool (e.g. Zoom, Teams) or conversation intelligence tool (e.g. Gong, Fireflies), paste it. I'll extract the key moments.

**Option 3: Describe the call**
Tell me what happened: "Had a discovery call with Acme Corp. Met with their VP Eng and CTO. They're evaluating us vs Competitor X. Main concern is integration timeline."

## Email Style Guidelines

When drafting customer-facing emails:

1. **Be concise but informative** — Get to the point quickly. Customers are busy.
2. **No markdown formatting** — Don't use asterisks, bold, or other markdown syntax. Write in plain text that looks natural in any email client.
3. **Use simple structure** — Short paragraphs, line breaks between sections. No headers or bullet formatting unless the customer's email client will render it.
4. **Keep it scannable** — If listing items, use plain dashes or numbers, not fancy formatting.

**Good:**
```
Here's what we discussed:
- Quote for 20 seats at $480/seat/year
- W9 and supplier onboarding docs
- Point of contact for the contract
```

**Bad:**
```
**What You Need from Us:**
- Quote for 20 seats at $480/seat/year
```

## Tips

1. **More detail = better output** — Even rough notes help. "They seemed concerned about X" is useful context.
2. **Name the attendees** — Helps me structure the summary and assign action items.
3. **Flag what matters** — If something was important, tell me: "The big thing was..."
4. **Tell me the deal stage** — Helps me tailor the follow-up tone and next steps.
